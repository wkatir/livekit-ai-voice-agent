# Task

      - Room type (Executive Suite, Deluxe Room, or Presidential Suite)

    - The ID of the event contains the room type.
    - The start time of the event is the check-in time.
    - If there is already an event in the calendar for that room type at that time, then the room is not available.

      Example: "Name: John Doe 
                Guests: 2"
    - The Check-in and check-out times are the start and end times of the event.
    - The room type is the field Summary.

    - The email should look like this:
    - Subject: Booking Confirmation for {room type}
